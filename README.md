# pandas-challenge

## Background ##
This project was assigned by the EDX Data Analytics Bootcamp program.
The main aim was to analyze an anonymous city's high school and standardized test data using Pandas library's DataFrames.
Data were originally saved as csv files, which were imported into Jupyter Notebook. The analysis and final outputs were also carried out in the Notebook (saved as an ipynb file named "main").

## Summary of Results ##
There were 15 schools and 39,170 students in the dataset. 

The total budget for the entire school disctrict was about $25 million. A higher percentage (85.8%) of students passed their reading test compared to 75% who passed math. Overall, 65% of all students passed their required math and reading tests.

When the data were examined at school level, the students' performance varied by school's spending, size and type.
Across the schools, higher spending did not improve students' performance. As they spent more on each student, the average test scores and overall passing rate decreased.
The results suggest that school size determines how well students perform on standardized tests--the average math scores in small (student count less than 1,000) and medium (student count between 1,000-2,000) were in the 80's, while large (student count between 2,000-5,000) schools' average math score was in the upper 70's. 
The overall passing rate decreased from about 90% for both small and medium-sized schools to 58% for large schools. 
There was a stark passing rate disparity between charter and district schools--90% of charter students passed both reading and math tests, whereas 54% of district students passed.
